# Background Information

I thought it would be fun to make a sort of storyboard which depicts a hypothetical scenario which is heavily inspired by course work I have recently completed as per my current cyber-security studies. The scenario involves implementing a (site-to-site and client-to-site) VPN solution within the premises of Moonbeam P.D, a police force agency located in the city of Miami.
